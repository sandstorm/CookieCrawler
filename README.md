# Sandstorm Cookie Crawler

This repo is currently WIP.

## The goal

We are aiming for a pragmatic approach for updating the cookie listing in the privacy statement of a webpage. 

For now we want the crawler to create a json file containing that information. This file can then be part of the next deployment and the cookie listing will be updated accordingly.

We also plan to provide a Neos plugin so the editor can place the listing anywhere on the page.

So stay tuned ;)

If you have any ideas or want to contribute please get in touch.
